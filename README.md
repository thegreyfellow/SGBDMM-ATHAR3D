### What is it ? ###

Brief history: This app was a part of a academic graduation project, I learnd JavaScript, using the library ThreeJS for interaction and control of 3D models, and Ruby's Sinatra framework.
It's still in version 0.0.1, and needs a lot of contribution.

The app is a 3D models Viewer and Composer in the sense of making new models using existing models,
and you can download it later when you finish.

###### Convert your models to .json format:

###### View your models:

###### Download your composed model, for later use with Blender or any 3D software:

### How do I get set up ? ###

You will need the sqlite3 on you system, and thats it, now launch sinatra with this:

`$ ruby main.rb`
