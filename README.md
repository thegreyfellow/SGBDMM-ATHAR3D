### SGBDMM-ATHAR3D ###

This app was a part of a academic graduation project, I learnd JavaScript and some ThreeJS cool stuff, and Ruby with Sinatra on the way out.
It's still in version 0.1.0, and needs a lot of contribution.


### How do I get set up? ###

This project does not have a gemfilefor now, but it only uses:
* ruby => 2.3.0
* sinatra => 1.4.7
* datamapper (latest)
* datamapper_sqlite (latest)
* sqlite3 (latest)

You will need the sqlite3 on you system, and thats it, now launch sinatra with this:

`$ ruby main.rb`

### Who do I talk to? ###

* for now you can just pm me if you need anything, or just fork and pull request if you have any changes to do I would be very greatfull :)
